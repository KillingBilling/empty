This is a source repo dummy for [KillingBilling](https://www.killingbilling.com/) API instances.

Although this repo contains no [billing plans](https://www.killingbilling.com/docs/billing-plans), you can still use KillingBilling [API](https://www.killingbilling.com/docs/api-reference) instances deployed from it (that is, your every new KillingBilling project) to manage basic account transactions for your end-users.

You can always deploy your very own custom billing plans [when you are ready](https://www.killingbilling.com/docs/getting-started).
